# Neural Architecture Search Demo (NAS)
A fully AI-generated project that auto-creates, trains, and selects the best neural network — without any APIs, static datasets, or manual logic.
## What It Does
This app simulates a real-world Neural Architecture Search (NAS) pipeline:
- Dynamically generates synthetic classification data
- Randomly builds small feedforward neural networks
- Trains and evaluates them on-the-fly
- Selects and shows the best-performing model
## Why This Project Matters
-  100% AI-generated logic — no static data, no manual formulas
-  Demonstrates the full ML lifecycle from data to decision
-  Runs on CPU and deploys free via Streamlit
-  Designed for job interviews and AI/ML portfolios
